# Super Simple Java Compilation Steps
- Open Command Prompt
- Press Win + R, type cmd, and hit Enter.
- Go to the folder with your Java file
- Example: if your file is on Desktop:
cd Desktop
- Write your Java program
- For exaample 
- Save it as Hello.java with this content:
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
    }
}
- Compile the program
- Run:
javac Hello.java
- This creates a file called Hello.class.
- Run the program
- Run:
java Hello
- Output will be:
Hello, Java!

  That’s it!
- javac = compiler (turns .java into .class).
- java = runner (executes the .class file).
- Always use the class name (not the filename) when running.
